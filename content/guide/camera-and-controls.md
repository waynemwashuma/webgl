# Camera and Controls

This guide assumes you already have a working render loop from [First Scene](/guide/first-scene).
Here, we only focus on camera setup and controls.

## What You Will Add

- one camera bound to a render target
- a perspective projection setup
- orbit controls for mouse/touch navigation

## Step 1: Import Camera APIs

```js
import {
  Camera,
  PerspectiveProjection,
  OrthographicProjection,
  OrbitCameraControls
} from "webgl";
```

You only need `OrthographicProjection` if you plan to switch projection type.

## Step 2: Create a Camera

```js
const camera = new Camera(target);
camera.transform.position.z = 3;
```

`target` should be your existing `CanvasTarget`.
The `z` offset keeps objects visible in front of the camera.

## Step 3: Configure Perspective Projection

```js
if (camera.projection instanceof PerspectiveProjection) {
  camera.projection.fov = Math.PI / 3;
  camera.projection.aspect = innerWidth / innerHeight;
}
```

Use this as the default for most real-time 3D scenes.

## Step 4: Add Orbit Controls

```js
const controls = new OrbitCameraControls(camera, canvas);
controls.distance = 4;
```

`canvas` should be the element receiving pointer input.
`distance` controls how far the orbit camera stays from its target.

## Step 5: Update Controls in the Frame Loop

```js
function frame() {
  controls.update();
  renderer.render([object, camera], device);
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}

requestAnimationFrame(frame);
```

Call `controls.update()` every frame before rendering.
If you skip it, input changes will not be applied.

## Switch to Orthographic Projection

Use orthographic projection when you need no perspective foreshortening.

```js
const ortho = new OrthographicProjection();
ortho.left = -5;
ortho.right = 5;
ortho.top = 5;
ortho.bottom = -5;

camera.projection = ortho;
```

For orthographic cameras, update bounds yourself when viewport shape changes.

## Reference Examples

If you want to compare against an example, see:

- [Orthographic Camera](/examples/camera/orthographic)

After this works, continue with [Materials and Lighting](/guide/materials-and-lighting).
