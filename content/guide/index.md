# Guide

This guide helps you build scenes with WebGLLIS using practical, task-first steps.

## Overview

WebGLLIS is a modular WebGL2 rendering library focused on explicit control: you compose render behavior with plugins, build scenes from reusable object/material/light primitives, and keep direct visibility into the render flow.

> [!WARNING]
> WebGLLIS is currently experimental and is not recommended for production use.
> Expect API changes, behavior changes and breaking changes as the library evolves.

This guide is structured to take you from first render to production-style scene setup. Instead of covering every class in isolation first, each chapter is anchored to a concrete task and points you to full runnable examples.

By the end of this guide, you should be able to:

- Set up a render loop with `WebGLRenderDevice`, `CanvasTarget`, and `WebGLRenderer`
- Build and animate scene objects with camera, materials, and lights
- Load texture/model assets and handle async content safely
- Use render targets and view configuration for offscreen and multi-view scenarios
- Understand the plugin-driven pipeline enough to debug and extend behavior

## Who This Guide Is For

Use this if you want direct WebGL2 control but still want reusable building blocks.

## How To Use This Guide

- New to WebGLLIS: follow the reading order from top to bottom.
- Migrating from another renderer: start at [First Scene](/guide/first-scene), then jump to [Plugins and Render Pipeline](/guide/plugins-and-render-pipeline).
- Looking for a specific API: use [API Map](/guide/api-map) as an index, then return to task pages for applied usage.
- Blocked on behavior: check [Troubleshooting](/guide/troubleshooting), then compare your setup against a matching example route.

## Core Flow

The snippet below creates the minimum pieces needed to render a scene:

```js
import { WebGLRenderDevice, CanvasTarget, WebGLRenderer, Camera } from "webgllis";

const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
const device = new WebGLRenderDevice(canvas, { depth: true });
const target = new CanvasTarget(canvas);
const renderer = new WebGLRenderer();
const camera = new Camera(target);
```
The `canvas` is the HTML surface where we draw on (or in a more technical terms, render to).
The `WebGLRenderDevice` executes our draw commands.
The `CanvasTarget` tells the camera where to render to. There is another type of target but thats for later.
The `WebGLRenderer` runs the render pipeline each frame.
The `Camera` provides view/projection data the renderer needs.

This snippet exists to show the baseline setup used in almost every example, so later chapters can add one concept at a time without repeating setup details.

For a complete runnable example, start with [Rotating Cube](/examples/other/rotatingCube).
